Service Layer: In Snowflake, the Service Layer is a critical component of the architecture that handles various functionalities such as query parsing, optimization, execution, transaction management, security, and metadata management. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the underlying storage and compute layers of Snowflake.  Logically, this can be assumed to hold the result cache â€“ a cached copy of the results of every query executed.
Compute Layer:  Which actually does the heavy lifting.  This is where the actual SQL is executed across the nodes of a Virtual Data Warehouse.  This layer holds a cache of raw data queried, and is often referred to as Local Disk I/O although in reality this is implemented using SSD storage.  All data in the compute layer is temporary, and only held as long as the virtual warehouse is active.
Compute Layer is responsible for executing queries and processing data. It is the component that performs the actual computation and analysis of data stored in Snowflake's distributed storage layer.
Storage Layer:  Which provides long term storage of results.  This is often referred to as Remote Disk, and is currently implemented on either Amazon S3 or Microsoft Blob storage.
